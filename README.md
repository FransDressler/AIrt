# AI rt

This notebook is about an Artificial Intelligence which should be used for photo to art augmentation. We developed this AI for the "Jugend Forscht" competition 2023 in Germany. Feel free to use it but it works more or less.

## Requirements

I would recommend using colab.research.google.com as an IDE because you'll need a GPU to train it. The training approximatly takes a few hours.

Besides that you need the datasets which you can download here: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/
 I would recommend only downloading one of the three artists and changing our code to only train on that one artist. 

 We tried to combine all three artists by feeding the AI different images but it just confused it.

 ## Recommendation

 I would also recommend using a google drive for saving the images and the training images because it makes it easy to synchronize with colab.
